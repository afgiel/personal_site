          <h4>Programming</h4>
          <p>I got my first exposure to programming in high school, when my friends and I hacked together some small iOS apps. Once I took my first formal class at Stanford, I was hooked and I haven't looked back. I have been coding for over 4 years now, both academically and professionally. To get a feel for my projects, check my <a href="http://www.github.com/afgiel">Github</a>.</p>

          <h4>Music</h4>
          <p>For as long as I can remember I have been a music junky. One of my favorite claims was I knew every lyric on my 8GB iPod by heart. Now my music taste is more in the instrumental spectrum, with some of my favorite artists being Flying Lotus, Giraffage, Chrome Sparks, Star Slinger, and Hudson Mowhawke.

          <h4>Data Science</h4>
          <p>During my time at Stanford, I quickly realized that my academic passion lie within the realm of data science and artificial intelligence. As such, I have spent my academic career studying machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. I hope to use these skills to transform data into meaninful products.</p> 

          <h4>Entrepreneurship</h4>
          <p>My bug for entrepreneurship started in high school, when my friends and I started an iOS development company to keep ourselves occupied. Now as a senior at Stanford, I see entrpreneurship as an amazing opportunity to work doing something I enjoy and maybe even change some lives for the better while I'm at it. </p>
